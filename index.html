      Festival productions take diverse forms, form intimate encounters in found spaces to the grand physical and
      emotional scale of Shakespearena drama, ballet and opera.
      There are portraits of individuals corrupted by power, testimonies from dissenting voices and challenges to
      received narratives. Some
      plays teem with the words and others are stripped back to essentials.
      What connects each is the need for an audience to gather togehter in a shared time and space.
      At a live performance we are alone with our thoughts but also participants in the public act that makes theatre
      happen.
